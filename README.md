# Exoplanet-Project-HAT-P16-b:
Another project, this time with aperture photomoetry: Ds9 and IRAF were used to reduce the data and apply aperture photometry
to images of Hatp16 in near UV. Again, this project was merely to understand the image calibration and data reduction processes
needed to extract the final light curve of the transit.
